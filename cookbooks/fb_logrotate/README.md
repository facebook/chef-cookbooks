fb_logrotate Cookbook
====================
This configures the logrotate package with common configs that go on
every server, but do not necessarily have a corresponding cookbook
they should go in.

If the system that this cookbook is run on is MAC OS X, it will populate all
the files outlined in the configration in the newsylog.d format.

See http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=newsyslog.conf
for more details about the newsyslog feature.

Requirements
------------

Attributes
----------
* node['fb_logrotate']['globals'][$CONFIG]
* node['fb_logrotate']['configs'][$NAME]
* node['fb_logrotate']['add_locking_to_logrotate']

Usage
-----
The configuration of logrotate via Chef is best explained by looking
directly at attributes/default.rb of this cookbook. A summary is below.

The `node['fb_logrotate']['configs']` hash contains one entry
per logrotate configuration block.

To rotate a new set of logs, add a new entry to this hash, like so:

    node['fb_logrotate']['configs']['myapp'] = {
      'files' => ['/var/log/myapp.log']
      'overrides' => {
        'missingok' => true,
      }
    }


The following defaults are provided:

Linux:
  daily
  rotate 14
  maxage 14
  compress
  compresscmd /usr/bin/pigz (except on CentOS 6, where pigz is not available)
  copytruncate
  notifempty
  missingok

MAC OS (BSD):
  rotate 14
  mode 644
  size 102400
  when *
  flags J

Of these compresscmd, rotate and maxage defaults are specified via
* node['fb_logrotate']['globals']['...']
These maybe overridden by recipes for a particular platform.

The following attributes are optional and not populated by default.
These can be then later specified by setting the appropriate attribute
and would get picked up by this logrotate recipe.
  size - specified by node['fb_logrotate']['globals']['size']

Overrides accepts the following booleans:
  copytruncate
  ifempty
  nocompress
  missingok
  sharedscripts
  nomail
  noolddir
  nocopytruncate
  dateext
  nodateext

Simply set them to true in your override hash to enable them. The following
additional overrides are accepted and require values:

  rotation     # this is how you specify daily/weekly/monthly/yearly
  rotate       # will be set to 14 if you choose daily but don't specify this
  size
  minsize
  create
  postrotate
  prerotate
  olddir
  su
  compressoptions
  dateformat
  owner (mac os x, BSD - only)
  pid_file (mac os x, BSD - only)
  sig_num (mac os x, BSD - only)

Please don't turn off compression unless you know what you are doing, and
please specify only the minimum of overrides.

IMPORTANT NOTE: No syntax checking is done for the logrotate configs.
You are responsible for ensuring you are entering correct, typo-free
data.

Let's go ahead and now take a look at a full sample structure, and
the resulting config file it would generate:

    default['fb_logrotate']['configs']['mcproxy'] = {
      'files' => [
        "/var/log/mcproxy-tao.log",
        "/var/log/mcproxy-tao2.log",
        "/var/log/mcproxy.init.log",
        "/var/log/mcproxy.tao.log",
        "/var/log/mcproxy.tao2.log",
        "/var/log/mcproxy2.tao.log",
        "/var/log/mcproxy.log.global",
        "/var/log/mcproxy.log",
        "/var/log/mcproxy.global",
        "/var/log/mcproxy.regional.log",
      ],
      'overrides' => {
        'size' => '50M',
        'copytruncate' => true,
        'missingok' => true,
        'sharedscripts' => true,
      },
    }

From the above structure, the following config file is generated:

    /var/log/mcproxy-tao.log /var/log/mcproxy-tao2.log /var/log/mcproxy.init.log /var/log/mcproxy.tao.log /var/log/mcproxy.tao2.log /var/log/mcproxy2.tao.log /var/log/mcproxy.log.global /var/log/mcproxy.log /var/log/mcproxy.global /var/log/mcproxy.regional.log {
      size 50M
      copytruncate
      missingok
      sharedscripts
    }

Another example that shows the newsyslog.d conf file as generated on a MAC
machine using the following sample strucutre:

    node.default['fb_logrotate']['configs']['mylogfile'] = {
      'files' => ['/var/log/mylogfile'],
      'overrides' => {
        'size' => '1048576', # 1GB
      },
    }

From the above structure, the a config file
(/etc/newsyslog.d/fb_bsd_newsyslog.conf) is generated with output:

```
# logfilename                       [owner:group]        mode count size     when  flags [/pid_file] [sig_num]
/var/log/messages                                        644  5     1024     24    J
/var/log/mylogfile                                       644  14    1048576  *     J
/var/log/secure                                          644  14    1048576  *     J
```

Note that by default rotations for /var/log/messages and /var/log/secure
are auto-populated into the newsyslog.d conf file.

### add_locking_to_logrotate
The `node['fb_logrotate']['add_locking_to_logrotate']` feature will *overwrite*
the cronjob for logrotate (/etc/cron.daily/logrotate) with one that wraps the
call to logrotate in a `flock` call to prevent logrotate runs from stepping on
each other. This can be very useful, but be aware you are overwriting a file from
the system package.
