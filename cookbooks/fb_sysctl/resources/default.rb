# Normally you'd expect to just run `sysctl -p` when you update the file.
# However, this isn't actually idempotent. It sets every single sysctl in
# /etc/sysctl.conf - even the ones that aren't changing... and some sysctls
# cause actions in the kernel upon writing (like dropping caches). We want
# to be fully idempotent and only set the things that have changed and honor
# the expectations the Chef users have around idempotency. So here we walk
# all of the ones we expect to be set and update only those that are not
# correct.
