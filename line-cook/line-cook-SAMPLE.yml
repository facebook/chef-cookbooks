# Example fbchefsync_bot.yaml configuration

# Bot label for PRs and issues (singular)
bot_label: "fbchef_sync_bot"

# Label for split PRs
split_label: "fbchef_sync_bot_pr_split"

# Bot command prefix
bot_command_prefix: "#fbchefsync"

# Additional universe upstreams
# Each entry requires 'prefix' and 'repo_url'
# Remote names are automatically: {prefix}upstream (e.g., pd_upstream)
universe_upstreams:
  pd-chef-cookbooks:   # name doesn't matter, just needs to be unique
    prefix: pd_
    repo_url: https://github.com/jaymzh/chef-fb-api-cookbooks.git
    branch: main        # Optional, defaults to 'main'
    ignore_cookbooks: []  # Optional, defaults to empty list

  # You can add more upstreams:
  # another-upstream:
  #   prefix: xyz_
  #   repo_url: https://github.com/example/chef-cookbooks.git
  #   ignore_cookbooks:
  #     - xyz_test

# IMPORTANT: Each upstream must have a unique prefix
# The bot will validate this on startup and fail if duplicates are found
