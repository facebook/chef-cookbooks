    # commentify() takes a text string and converts it to a (possibly)
    # multi-line comment suitable for dropping into a config file.
    #
    # Usage:
    #   commentify(text, argHash)
    #
    # Arguments:
    #   text:    Required string. The string to convert to a commnent
    #   arghash: An optional hash with the following (optional) keys:
    #   arghash['start']:     String to use for starting comment char(s)
    #                         Defaults to '#'
    #   arghash['finish']:    String used to close off entire
    #                         section of text, instead of leading each line
    #                         Defaults to empty string.
    #   arghash['width']:     Total line width (integer) of the config file.
    #                         Defaults to 80.
    #
    # Notes:
    # - 'text' arg will have all whitespace (including newlines) collapsed to a
    #   single space.
    # - If only 'start' is specified, string will be broken up into
    #   multiple lines, with each preceded by the start tag and padding
    # - If 'finish' is also specified, the entire string will be broken up
    #   similarly to above, except that only one leading and one trailing
    #   tag are used in total.
    # - Line width is the total width of the file you are inserting comments
    #   into, including the leading comment chars and padding
    # - Any words (tokens) longer than a full line are inserted at the start of
    #   their own line and printed contiguously in the config file. They will
    #   NOT be split up among multiple-lines.
    # - A minimum of one trailing space will be used as padding for each line

commentify() takes one required string argument, followed by an optional hash.
