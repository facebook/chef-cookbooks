fb_tmpclean Cookbook
====================
This cookbook allows you to customize how you would like directories cleaned
to ensure more appropriate filesystem cleanup.

Supports two platforms:
CentOS = tmpwatch
OS X = tmpreaper

Requirements
------------

Attributes
----------
* node['fb_tmpclean']['default_files']
* node['fb_tmpclean']['directories']
* node['fb_tmpclean']['excludes']
* node['fb_tmpclean']['timestamptype']
* node['fb_tmpclean']['extra_lines']

Usage
-----
Anywhere, in any cookbook, you can set tmpclean to be tuned to the needs of a
tier or server. By default, tmpclean takes time in hours, or you may suffix
with `m` (minutes), `h` (hours), or `d` (days).

The attributes are used like this:

### default_files

This is the lifetime of the files that are cleaned up by default by
the respective packages. It defaults to 240, and the files covered are:

* CentOS Includes (if exists)
  `/var/{cache/man,catman}/{cat?,X11R6/cat?,local/cat?}`

### directories

This is a hash of directories you'd like cleaned and the lifetime of files.

Add other entries as you need.

### excludes

This is an array of files to exclude from cleaning in all directories listed in
`node['fb_tmpclean']['directories']`.

Both tmpwatch (CentOS) and tmpreaper (OS X) use shell patterns for `excludes`.
However, these "shell patterns" differ subtly on the two platforms, so test
carefully. See P56078024 and P56078014 for a comparison. The defaults for
`excludes` change per platform.

When the cron job is built, each of the excludes is appended to the list of
directories with a slash appended to the directory name. An exclusion of
/tmp/file with a directory of /tmp will result in a -X of /tmp//tmp/file.
The way the options are constructed, each exclusion is appended to each
directory to create absolute paths.

    for dir in directories:
        for exclusion in exclusions:
            print '-X ' + dir + '/' + exclusions

### timestamptype

By default we tell tmpwatch (in CentOS) to use mtime, but you can change this
by setting `node['fb_tmpclean']['timestamptype']` to `atime`.

This setting has no effect on Mac OS X.

### extra_lines

An array of extra lines that will be put, verbatim, into the config file.

Examples:

    node.default['fb_tmpclean']['directories']['/home/zuck'] = 1
    node.default['fb_tmpclean']['extra_lines'] << "LINE"

### remove_special_files

A boolean value which determines whether or not tmpwatch will remove special
filetypes.

Defaults:

* default_files = 240 hours
* excludes are set per-platform based on the tool's defaults. See
  `attributes/default.rb'
* remove_special_files = false to avoid a default case that may be dangerous
