Usage: $0 [<options>]

OPTIONS
    -c <cookbook>
        Compare just <cookbook>

    -d
        Diff mode.

    -h
        This.

    -i <dir>
        Where your clone of the INTERNAL repo is.
        Default: $internaldir

    -p
        Push changes internal -> upstream

    -s
        Sync changes upstream -> internal

    -u <dir>
        Where your clone of the UPSTREAM repo is.
        Default: $internaldir

CONFIG FILE
You can also tell this script where your repos are by creating $CONF
in shell format and defining 'upstreamdir' and 'internaldir', like so:

    upstreamdir="\$HOME/mycheckouts/chef-cookbooks"
    internaldir="\$HOME/mycheckouts/chef"

GENERAL USAGE
    # get a list of cookbooks that differ
    $ $0
    ...
    fb_sysfs does not match
    ...

    # Get a diff for a specific cookbook
    $ $0 -c fb_sysfs
    ...

    # Pull in upstream changes
    $ $0 -c fb_sysfs -s
    ...

    # OR.... push out internal changes
    $ $0 -c fb_sysfs -p

EOF
}

# people put repos in different places, don't make them pass in
# -u and -i every time.
if [ -e "$CONF" ]; then
    # shellcheck disable=SC1090
    source "$CONF" || die "Configuration file $CONF malformed"
