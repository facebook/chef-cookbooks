Other attribute-driven API cookbook repos
=========================================

This is a list of other repos that house attribute-driven API cookbooks. If you
send a pull request to add a repo to this, we will check the repo to ensure it
closely follows the model before merging it. However, we will not follow that
repo, so we make no guarantees about the state of repos in this file. We do
reserve the right to remove repos from this file which do not follow the
attribute-driven-API model.

There are a variety of requirements for repos that appear here, be sure to
read [CREATING_UNIVERSE_REPOS.md](docs/CREATING_UNIVERSE_REPOS.md).
